2.1. How many tons worth of fruit does an average seller have?

# here we need only seller_info table.
# at the first step we calculate average fruit weight for every seller.
# and at the second one we take average of that values.

SELECT AVG(average_fruit_weight)
FROM
    (
        SELECT AVG(fruit_weight) AS average_fruit_weight
        FROM seller_info
        GROUP BY seller_id
    )

2.2. How many sellers have at least one client who purchased their fruit?

# in this case we can use only consumption_info table.
# if seller doesn't have any clients - he is not present in the table.
# so all of the sellers in the consumption_info table have at least one client.
# that is why we just need to count all unique seller_id

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT seller_id) FROM consumption_info
